Stock analysis application using AI

Create a full stack development code for a AI based Predictive Analysis application to fetch market data for stocks (BSE,NSE), train the data to analyse the past price  performance (application user selects the period )and predicts the price movement for the future of the selected date. The application also interprets News Analysis and Sentiment Analysis to train the data.. Use the advanced technologies available for stock price levels calculations. Application should have a user friendly GUI based interface to interact with user, any standard template (eg.figma) can be adopted.
Application stack should contain necessary backend eg.g., Node.js), frontend (eg.React), middlewar and database.
 
To develop a truly powerful and accurate predictive analytics tool for stock market analysis, we need to focus on three pillars: robust data processing, advanced predictive modeling, and a user-centric design. Here's a comprehensive roadmap for each critical aspect:
1. Data Pipeline: Ensuring Robust and Real-Time Data
To ensure accurate predictions, the data pipeline must be built to handle multiple sources of input, including historical stock data, live market data, and sentiment information.
Key Steps:
Historical Stock Data:
 Use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or direct BSE/NSE integration to pull stock price data, volumes, and key financial indicators.
 Fetch advanced features like moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Fibonacci retracements for technical analysis.
Live Market Data:
 Implement WebSockets for real-time updates on stock price changes and trends.
 Cache frequently fetched data using Redis or Memcached to enhance responsiveness.
News and Sentiment Analysis:
 Scrape or use APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Financial Times API) for market-related news articles.
 Use NLP techniques to analyze sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and quantify its impact on stock prices using libraries like TextBlob, VADER, or spaCy.
 Data Storage:
 Store raw and processed data in PostgreSQL or MongoDB with table relationships for:
 Historical Data (stock_symbol, date, open, close, etc.).
 Sentiment Data (headline, sentiment_score, source).
 Live Data (price, volume, timestamp).
2. Predictive Modeling: Leveraging State-of-the-Art AI
To predict future stock prices and trends, we’ll build and fine-tune machine learning models.
Key Techniques:
Feature Engineering:
 Incorporate technical indicators (e.g., MACD, EMA, RSI) as model input.
 Include sentiment scores and market events for a holistic approach.
 Normalize data using MinMaxScaler for compatibility with neural networks.
Model Selection:
 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
 Suitable for time-series data and long-term dependencies.
 Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for implementation.
Transformer Models:
 Apply architectures like GPT or BERT to encode both numerical and textual data for enhanced predictions.
Hybrid Models:
 Combine LSTM for time-series analysis and Transformers for sentiment interpretation.
 Training and Optimization:
 Use historical data to train models with features like:
 Stock prices for 60-90 previous days as input.
 Sentiment impact from headlines/news.
 Optimize using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning with frameworks like Optuna.
Evaluation Metrics:
 Measure accuracy with metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
 Use back-testing to validate predictions against historical data.
3. User-Centric Design: Creating a Powerful and Intuitive Interface
A good user interface should make predictive analytics accessible and understandable, even for non-technical users.
Key UI Features:
Interactive Dashboards:
 Display real-time portfolio values, watchlist stocks, and predictions.
 Include widgets for stock selection, time period, and prediction settings.
Visualizations:
 Line charts for historical and predicted price movements (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js).
 Sentiment and news impact visualized as bar/pie charts.
Customizability:
 Allow users to configure dashboards (e.g., add/remove stocks, set alerts for price levels).
 Ease of Navigation:
 Use React’s component-based architecture with routing for intuitive navigation between features like portfolio, predictions, and news.
4. Advanced Enhancements
Real-Time Alerts:
Use WebSockets to notify users of significant price changes or breaking news.
Integration with Social Media:
Analyze Twitter sentiment for stocks using hashtags (e.g., $TSLA).
Multi-Language Support:
Add i18n for regional users.
Deployment and Scaling
Infrastructure:
 Use Kubernetes for scaling backend services.
 Deploy AI models on cloud GPUs for fast predictions (e.g., AWS SageMaker or Google AI Platform).
 CI/CD Pipeline:
 Automate deployment using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
 Application Overview After Deployment
The deployed application will include the following sections for users:
 Landing Page (Home):
 Displays a welcome message with navigation to login or register.
Explains the core features of the application, e.g., stock analysis, portfolio management, predictions, and live data.
 
User Authentication:
 
Login/Signup page with forms for user credentials.
 
Post login, users are directed to their Dashboard.
 
Dashboard:
 
A summary of the user's portfolio, watchlist, and live market updates.
 
Buttons or widgets for:
 
Adding stocks to the portfolio or watchlist.
 
Fetching live market data.
 
Viewing predictions based on the selected stock and time period.
 
A news section for stock-related sentiment insights.
 
Stock Search and Predictions:
 
A search bar for finding stocks by symbol.
 
Visualization of historical data with future predictions using interactive charts.
 
Sentiment analysis scores alongside graphical indicators (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
 
Portfolio Management:
 
Allows users to:
 
Add or remove stocks in their portfolio.
 
View the portfolio’s current value.
 
Track stock performance over time.
 
Watchlist:
 
Users can monitor specific stocks without adding them to the portfolio.
 
Real-time updates for stock prices and trends.
 
Data Flow Architecture (Schema)
Here’s the architecture and schema of your application:
 
Frontend (React):
Components:
 
Auth (Login/Signup): Interacts with the backend for user authentication.
 
Dashboard: Displays user-specific data fetched from APIs.
 
StockSearch: Allows users to fetch stock data and train models for predictions.
 
Portfolio: Manages user portfolio data.
 
Watchlist: Keeps track of selected stocks.
 
Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL):
Endpoints:
 
/api/auth/register: Registers a new user.
 
/api/auth/login: Authenticates users and returns a JWT.
 
/api/stocks/fetch: Fetches historical stock data for analysis.
 
/api/stocks/predict: Calls the ML API to generate stock price predictions.
 
/api/portfolio: CRUD operations for the user portfolio.
 
/api/watchlist: CRUD operations for the watchlist.
 
Machine Learning API (Flask):
Endpoints:
 
/api/predict: Accepts stock symbol and time period, returns predictions.
 
/api/sentiment: Analyzes stock-related headlines and returns sentiment scores.
 
User Interaction Workflow
User Logs In:
 
Authenticated users are redirected to their personalized dashboard.
 
Backend validates credentials and generates a session token (JWT).
 
Stock Analysis:
 
Users input stock symbols and select a time period.
 
Backend queries market data APIs and sends historical data to the ML service.
 
ML API processes the data and returns predictions, visualized in charts.
 
Portfolio Updates:
 
CRUD operations on the portfolio table enable users to add, edit, and remove stocks.
 
Watchlist Management:
 
Users add or remove stocks from their watchlist, stored in the database.
 
Sentiment Analysis:
 
Headlines fetched from news APIs are sent to the ML API for sentiment scores.
 
Results are displayed as visual indicators (e.g., red for negative, green for positive).
